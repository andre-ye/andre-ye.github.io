My basic propositions. Subject to continual revision.

1. Live your life with purpose. Never unconsciously wander.
2. Resist inauthentic purposes which have been blindly handed down to you.
3. Never worship purpose. It is a way of living, not an ideal.
4. Embrace your radical freedom. Accept your radical responsibility.

Live as a [melancholic](https://andre-ye.github.io/writing/files/object-and-orgasm.pdf){:target="_blank"}. It is the only way to live in accordance with these propositions.
