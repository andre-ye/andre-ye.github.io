### Philosophy

Articles
- ["The Revolt of the Salaried Bourgeoisie"](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v34/n02/slavoj-zizek/the-revolt-of-the-salaried-bourgeoisie){:target="_blank"}, Slavoj Žižek -- an important update to Marxist analysis for the 21st century economy, especially for tech workers
- ["Philosophy: Who Needs It?"](https://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Philosophy-Who-Needs-It-text.pdf){:target="_blank"}, Ayn Rand -- a rhetorically effective and accessible explanation for why philosophy is more important than ever, which I recommend to anyone who is skeptical of or new to philosophy
- ["Rawls' Law of Peoples: Rules for a Vanished Westphalian World"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/233370){:target="_blank"}, Allen Buchanan -- an interesting philosophical historicization of Rawls which strikes at a deep gash in political philosophy itself.
- ["Rawls, Hegel, and Communitarianism"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/192057){:target="_blank"}, Sibyl A. Schwarzenbach -- an interesting attempt at the very difficult project of writing coherently on Rawls and Hegel in the same paragraph.
<!-- - ["The Ethical Significance of Nationality"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2380889){:target="_blank"}, David Miller -- what I would call (no doubt with controversy) a proto-phenomenological approach to political philosophy: a return to the Delphic motto, "know thyself!" -->
- ["Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066){:target="_blank"}, Donna Haraway -- great and nuanced discussion of object(ivity) and the subject, employing the vision metaphor
- ["Epistemologies of Ignorance"](https://kwanj.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/alcoff-epistemologies-of-ignorance-three-types.pdf){:target="_blank"}, Linda Alcoff -- interesting synthesis of thinkers on ignorance

- *Queer Phenomenology*, Sara Ahmed
- *Sex and the Failed Absolute*, Slavoj Žižek
- *The Birth of Computer Vision*, James E. Dodson

<!-- - *Being and Nothingness*, Jean-Paul Sartre -- the classic existentialist text; a wonderful medium for self-reflection and meditation -->
