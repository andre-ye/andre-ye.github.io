### Philosophy

Articles
- ["The Revolt of the Salaried Bourgeoisie"](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v34/n02/slavoj-zizek/the-revolt-of-the-salaried-bourgeoisie){:target="_blank"}, Slavoj Žižek -- an important update to Marxist analysis for the 21st century economy, especially for tech workers
- ["Philosophy: Who Needs It?"](https://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Philosophy-Who-Needs-It-text.pdf){:target="_blank"}, Ayn Rand -- a rhetorically effective and accessible explanation for why philosophy is more important than ever, which I recommend to anyone who is skeptical of or new to philosophy
- ["Rawls' Law of Peoples: Rules for a Vanished Westphalian World"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/233370){:target="_blank"}, Allen Buchanan -- an interesting philosophical historicization of Rawls which strikes at a deep gash in political philosophy itself.
- ["Rawls, Hegel, and Communitarianism"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/192057){:target="_blank"}, Sibyl A. Schwarzenbach -- an interesting attempt at the very difficult project of writing coherently on Rawls and Hegel in the same paragraph.

Books
- *The Poverty of Ethics*, Anat Amar -- a brilliant synthesis of analytic ethics and Continental discontent.
- *Queer Phenomenology*, Sara Ahmed -- a phenomenological account of queer bodies and spaces which leads us towards a socially-aware phenomenology of phenomenology
- *Sex and the Failed Absolute*, Slavoj Zizek -- an ingenious and culturally aware synthesis of psycholanalysis and Hegel, through a triadic topological analogy
- *Being and Nothingness*, Jean-Paul Sartre -- the classic existentialist text; a wonderful medium for self-reflection and meditation

### Film
Movies
- *Summer of '85* -- a more sensitive and textually self-aware *Call Me By Your Name*

- *La La Land* -- beautiful cinematography and play with destiny and time
- *Parasite* -- biting social critique of globalized capitalism
- *2001: A Space Odyssey* -- an unhurried and thoughtful meditation on technology and Nietzschian transcendence

- *Midsommar* -- a beautiful film, and a deeply disturbing exploration of the "anthropologist's gaze"

TV Shows
- *Succession* -- an edgy portrayal of family, politics, and corporate power
- *The White Lotus* -- brilliantly nuanced portrays of colonial, racial, and sexual tensions in bourgeois society

Documentary
- *Hearts and Minds* -- a brutally material portrayal of horror and patriotism in the Vietnam War, terrifying in its nakedness
