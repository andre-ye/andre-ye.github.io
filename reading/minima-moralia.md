Theodor W. Adorno wrote *Minima Moralia: Reflections From Damaged Life* in 1951.
It is a series of 153 aphorisms striking at the sad ridiculity of living the Aristotelian "good life" in the 20th and 21st centuries.
I am reading one aphorism a day and adding it to this page.

"Life does not live." – Ferdinand Kürnberger

1. "*For Marcel Proust.*" **Intellectual work has been departmentalized**; the pursuit of anti-business rendered a business in its very structure. Financially independent scholars often fail to recognize this, and are punished for their ignorance.
2. "*Grassy Seat.*" **The familial order is dying a brutal death, at the hands of righteous blind children.** We only know Oedipus without motherly love, that is, the slaying of the father
3.
