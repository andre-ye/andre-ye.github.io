Since my first quarter at the UW, I've been pushing notes from my courses to this website. By now, there are notes for over 30 courses. Although this repository is certainly of personal value for me, I also hope that it may be able to help others if they need it. Visit the website [here](https://andre-ye.github.io/uni/){:target="_blank"}.

Some of my favorite notes pages:
- [Reading notes](https://andre-ye.github.io/uni/docs/phil/phil-440/readings/){:target="_blank"} from PHIL 440, Normative Ethics
- [Lecture notes](https://andre-ye.github.io/uni/docs/phil/phil-458/lecture/){:target="_blank"} from PHIL 458, Phenomenology
- [Lecture notes](https://andre-ye.github.io/uni/docs/eng/engl-308/lecture/){:target="_blank"} from ENGL 308, Marxism and Marxist Literary Theory
- [Lecture notes](https://andre-ye.github.io/uni/docs/hum/hstaa-465/lecture/){:target="_blank"} from HSTAA 465, The Sixties in America
- [Lecture notes](https://andre-ye.github.io/uni/docs/cs/cse-312/lecture/){:target="_blank"} from CSE 312, Principles of Computing II
