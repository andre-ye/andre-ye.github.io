The [Transition School](){:target="_blank"} is a one-year intensive program at the Robinson Center which prepares students coming out of eighth grade for freshman year at the University of Washington. I've been pushing my notes for each of the courses to this site.  I hope it will be of use to current TS students even if the curriculum has changed, and of interest to prospective TS students. Visit the website [here](https://andre-ye.github.io/ts/){:target="_blank"}.

Some of my favorite notes pages:
- [Reading notes](https://andre-ye.github.io/ts/docs/english/spring/reading){:target="_blank"}, English -- spring quarter
- [Lecture notes](https://andre-ye.github.io/ts/docs/history/winter/lecture/){:target="_blank"}, History -- winter quarter
- [Reading notes](https://andre-ye.github.io/ts/docs/english/spring/reading){:target="_blank"}, English -- spring quarter
- [Math homeworks](https://andre-ye.github.io/ts/docs/math){:target="_blank"}
- A [portfolio](https://andre-ye.github.io/ts/docs/portfolio){:target="_blank"} of my major work at TS
