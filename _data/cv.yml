      description:
        - Thesis - Insofar as morality is a social(ogical) object with a complex geneology and LLMs learn the statistical structure of social totality, unaligned LLMs grasp morality in concept. We distinguish value pluralism in content, the current ‘default’, and pluralism in concept.
        - Collaborator - Mark Pock. Advisor - Jared Moore.
