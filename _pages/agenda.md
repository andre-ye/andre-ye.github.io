Some of the ideas I have been mulling on.
Please see [PhD SOP](https://andre-ye.org/assets/pdf/phd-sop.pdf){:target="_blank"} for one aspect of my interests, and [great articles I've been reading](https://andre-ye.org/me-like/articles/){:target="_blank"}.
**Still under construction.**

<div class="agenda-title">Concept Definition</div>
<div class="agenda-description">
The computational abstractions which have been useful for the field of interpretability may be useful abstractions for defining concepts.
Therefore, in an "interpretability as interaction" paradigm, concept definition does not only have to look like explaining something to someone, "thinking in your own head", or writing an essay, but also in *discovering the right language model internals* that capture a concept (e.g. vectors, sparse autoencoder features).
More forthcoming.

### exciting ideas and directions
Kernels of research ideas I'm excited about.
If any of these excite you too, please shoot me an email at `andreye [at] uw [dot] edu`!

AI Tools for Thought / Textual Social Sciences
- Proactively asking great questions is a core part of thinking. Being asked a challenging question is how humans become conscious of what they don't know they don't know -- we're intellectually "caught off guard". But it's very difficult to ask great questions. How can AI systems do it?
- Critical learning often takes the practical form of figuring out what words mean. (Think philosopy 101: figuring out what "metaphysics", "contingency", "normative" mean.) Formal definitions are only a scaffold. The real conceptual grasp of the term comes from reading a multitude of texts which cross-reference and build up the term. Can LMs introduce "new" words developing "new" concepts, and thus contribute towards human "intelligence augmentation"?

Digital Tools for Metaphilosophy
- Expanding the modalities in which we do philosophy beyond the text document
- Data sheets are a now a commonplace practice for machine learning datasets to contextualize where they are coming from, their methodology, and their limitations. Can we extract and deploy "metaphilosophy data sheets"?
- Can intelligent tools and interfaces help bridge intellectual divides in philosophy (e.g. analytic-continental, canon-periphery)?

Philosophical meditations on AI
- An exploration of what "selfhood" means for AI -- what does it mean when models say "As an AI language model..."? What might it mean to negate the [sycophantic, servile, mirror-like nature](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07350.pdf){:target="_blank"} many current language models have been aligned to?
- Critique of the utilitarian priority of "preferences" in alignment, mayhaps borrowing from the Frankfurt School.
- The kind of thing [Borges and AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01425.pdf){:target="_blank"} does, but with someone like Baudrillard, Nietzsche, Foucault.
- Developing VilÃ©m Flusser's notion of technical images for computer vision. See: [Into the Universe of Technical Images](https://www.are.na/block/3080997){:target="_blank"}.
- Theorizing if computer vision (and/or language modeling) is guilty of what Donna Haraway calls the 'god trick', and building information systems which reflect Haraway's maxim that objectivity is partial perspective. See: [Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective](){:target="_blank"} and [A Cyborg Manifesto](){:target="_blank"}. ["Situated Cameras, Situated Knowledges"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00064.pdf){:target="_blank"} is a great start.
- What happens if we take Iris Murdoch's notion of 'moral vision' literally? Murdoch says that "moral differences are differences in vision" -- what we need is not a "renewed attempt to specify the facts but rather a fresh vision". What does this mean for computer vision? -->
