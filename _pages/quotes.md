An unorganized and continuously growing archive of quotes, ideas, and works that influence or represent my thought in some way across a wide range of topics.
To maximize each item's exposure, the order of categories and order of quotes within each category are randomly reordered each day.
I continuously add to this page. <a href="/assets/json/quotes.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="bubble-link">Download JSON</a>
