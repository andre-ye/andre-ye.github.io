I am an incoming EECS PhD student at MIT working in **human-AI interaction**, advised by [Mitchell Gordon](https://mgordon.me/){:target="_blank"}.
I want to build **AI concept tools** that help us *define* and *collaborate* on concepts (personal, ethical, political, scientific, ...) in the form of neologisms , metaphors, connections, graphs, and more.
I want to find AI-readable formats and operations for representing (trans-?)humanist concepts --- with wacky, creative, speculative human-AI interactions.
My philosophical interests are in philosophies that center the structuring role of concepts in life and thought, e.g. Deleuze, Foucault, Sellars.

My email is `andreye [at] mit [dot] edu`.

  This is a randomly chosen image from <a href="https://betterimagesofai.org/images" target="_blank">Better Images of AI</a>, an excellent project which seeks to supplement and challenge dominant visualization of AI as a Terminator-robot-agent by emphasizing how people, data, labor, resources, and ideas go into making AI.
