<!-- I am currently relocating my personal website. You can view my original website [here](https://andre-ye.github.io/andre-ye.github.io-retired/){:target="_blank"} while I am transferring. -->

I am an honors, Phi Beta Kappa, and Mary Gates scholar at the University of Washington studying philosophy and computer science, minoring in math and history.
*Long term*, I want to build **AI tools for thought** (esp. for the textual social sciences).
*Short term*, I want to build AI which can proactively ask thought-provoking questions and introduce **new conceptual vocabulary**.
My general intellectual interests include phenomenology, philosophy of science, and human-computer interaction.
Please see my [research agenda](/agenda) and [CV](/cv) for more details.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Amy Zhang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz/){:target="_blank"}, [Ranjay Krishna](https://ranjaykrishna.com/index.html){:target="_blank"}, and [Rose Novick](https://www.rosenovick.com/){:target="_blank"}.

<!-- My interest is in the philosophy of technology and AI.
I think that we need to understand the metaphysical and political structure of data and models in order to understand their ethical/normative character.

Some questions which excite me are:
Can we develop an ontology of datasets, models, and information (flow)?
What does this mean for ethical questions of consent, privacy, and property in human-AI interactions?
Does AI stand for $$\{$$epistemic, political, ethical$$\}$$ universality? -- and what are complications with value pluralism and other analytic ethical frameworks for AI which assume either universality or particularity?

My previous work has been in varied areas of computer vision and HCI, with a focus on human subjectivity and challenging singular ground truths.

<!-- **Philosophy Interest Statement.** Aphorism 127 in Adorno’s *Minima Moralia* declares, “Intelligence is a moral category.” Every rational and intellectual endeavor expresses an ethical orientation. One usually takes from this that we need a meditation on the ethical waste and peril of human intellectual histories. But intelligence is no longer obviously an anthropocentric feature. My academic interest is in subjecting non-human intelligences (“AI”) to this very sort of meditation. Is the only ethical significance of AI the one that humans imbue into it? Might AI’s persistent exteriority to “HI” (Human Intelligence) better capture truths which themselves elude the rational (human) ego? Can AI ‘do’ philosophy, and does it represent a break in the history of philosophy?

**Computer Science Interest Statement.**
Computer vision research builds datasets that assign a single human label to images. Models are often trained under the implicit assumption that this label is indisputable. I am interested in challenging this assumption by exploring how data and machine learning systems can better reflect and engage with human subjectivity across a wide variety of real-world problems.
