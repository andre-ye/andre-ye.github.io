I am an MIT EECS PhD student, PD Soros Fellow, and NSF GRFP Fellow working in **human-AI interaction**, advised by [Mitchell Gordon](https://mgordon.me/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I want to build **AI concept tools** that help us *define*, *develop*, and *collaborate* on humanistic concepts (personal, social, ethical, political, scientific, …) in the form of neologisms, metaphors, connections, graphs, and more beyond the chat interface. I have philosophical interests in work that centers the structuring role of concepts in life and thinking, from Deleuze to Foucault to Brandom.

I am currently working on a framework enabling humans to better understand and intervene on the intermediate decisions that LLMs rely on in "solving" complex open-ended tasks (specifically, in philosophy, AI alignment, and poetry). Stay tuned!
In the past, I have explored [what philosophers think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04516){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} about improving LLMs, how the ["woke Gemini"](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/23/google-gemini-images-stereotypes-controversy){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} controversy could [instruct us in more critical creative practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15242){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and other ideas in [computer science](/work/cs/) and [philosophy](/work/philosophy/).
Find what I'm thinking about for now and the future [here](/work/agenda/).

  This is a randomly chosen image from <a href="https://betterimagesofai.org/images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Better Images of AI</a>, an excellent project which seeks to supplement and challenge dominant visualization of AI as a Terminator-robot-agent by emphasizing how people, data, labor, resources, and ideas go into making AI.
