I am currently relocating my personal website. You can view my original website [here](https://andre-ye.github.io/andre-ye.github.io-retired/){:target="_blank"} while I am transferring.

I am an undergraduate at the University of Washington studying philosophy and computer science. My interest is in the philosophy of AI, specifically political/ethical, ontological, and cultural dimensions. Some questions which excite me are:
How to cultural differences in humans manifest in models?
Does AI constitute universality, and what ethical and political difficulties arise? What are complications with value pluralism in AI?

Currently, I am working with Prof. Ranjay Krishna, Prof. Amy Zhang, and PhD student Sebastin Santy on vision understanding models' internalization of cross-cultural perceptual differences. Previously, I worked in the Social Futures Lab and the Najafian Lab.

I have written a few essays in philosophy, two books on deep learning, and many data science articles. etc.
