<!-- I am currently relocating my personal website. You can view my original website [here](https://andre-ye.github.io/andre-ye.github.io-retired/){:target="_blank"} while I am transferring. -->

I am an undergraduate at the University of Washington studying philosophy and computer science. My interest is in the philosophy of technology and AI -- specifically political/ethical, ontological, and cultural dimensions. Some questions which excite me are:
How to  models reflect and distort cultural differences among humans?
Does AI stand for universality, and what ethical and political difficulties arise?
What are complications with value pluralism in AI?

Currently, I am working with
Prof. [Ranjay Krishna](https://ranjaykrishna.com/index.html){:target="_blank"}, 
Prof. [Amy Zhang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz/){:target="_blank"}, and 
PhD student [Sebastin Santy](https://sebastinsanty.com/){:target="_blank"} 
on cross-cultural [perceptual differences](/projects/cv_cognition/){:target="_blank"} in vision understanding models;
as well as with
[Jared Moore](https://jaredmoore.org/){:target="_blank"}
and Mark Pock on social intentionality in AI.
Previously, I worked in the 
[Social Futures Lab](https://social.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"}
on [uncertainty representation](/projects/confidence_contours/){:target="_blank"} in segmentation models, 
the [Najafian Lab](https://dlmp.uw.edu/research-labs/najafian/najafian-lab-members){:target="_blank"}
on the [segmentation](/projects/foot_process_seg/){:target="_blank"} of kidney structures, and 
[Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/){:target="_blank"}
on curriculum learning in large transcription models.
I have written a few [essays](/writing/philosophy){:target="_blank"} in philosophy, [two](/writing/mdldna){:target="_blank"} [books](/writing/mdl4td){:target="_blank"} on deep learning, a little bit of [fiction](/writing/fiction){:target="_blank"}, and many [data science articles](https://andre-ye.medium.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy listening to [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06KiOj6gjbs){:target="_blank"} by Slavoj Zizek (my favorite undead philosopher), playing piano, learning Russian and French, and thinking about swimming in the eternally incomplete UW pool. I'm always up for a chat, so feel free to reach out.
