An unorganized and continuously growing archive of quotes, ideas, and works that have profoundly influenced my thohught across a wide range of topics, including: the nature of philosophy (and of "nature"), personal and political ethics, (anti-)metaphysics, how we should design AI, the social structure of science and knowledge, "the meaning of *my* life".

Currently under construction.

*Resisting social interpellation, even innocuous interpellation.*
- “Don’t walk behind me, I may not lead. Don’t walk infront of me, I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend." -- (supposedly but probably not) Albert Camus.
- “Do not ask who I am and do not ask me to remain the same: leave it to our bureaucrats and our police to see that our papers are in order.” -- Michel Foucault

*Looking at collective systems of meaning as revealing important structural and geneological features of the (social) world. This entails a sort of "pragmatist' philosophical view, pragmatically speaking.*
- "For language is the armory of the human mind; and at once contains the trophies of its past, and the weapons of its future conquests." -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
- "We are accustomed to call concepts metaphysical if we have forgotten how we reached them. One can never lose one’s footing, or come into collision with facts, if one always keeps in view the path by which one has come." -- Ernst Mach.

*The great utility of existential phenomenology in making sense of our experience and ethical life.*
- Forthcoming.
- Sartre
- Geworfenheit

*AI tools must break in the right ways to help us think better. We must not be total masters.*
- Heidegger's tool breaking
- Hegel master-slave dialectic
- Intention is not all you need
- Antagonistic AI

*Skepticism of Platonist formulations of "evil", "suffering", and "identity" in ethics and politics. It means an embrace of freedom, flux, change, and becoming; and resisting ethical essentialisms in all of their forms, whether it is from (post-)Christian thought, "woke identitarian politics", scientific determinism, technological utopianism/doomerism, certain kinds of nationalism/cosmopolitanism.*
- Banality of evil
- Palestine interview
- Sartre
- Nietzsche
- Murdoch
- Butler
- Deleuze
- Critique of Marx

*Philosophy is always reactive towards real problems, and works towards them by creating new concepts. Philosophy should not fall into Plato's cavernous trap and delude itself of its isolated importance.*
- "The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk." -- Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.
- Wimsatt
- Feminist philosophers of science (Haraway)
- Deleuze
