An unorganized and continuously growing archive of quotes, ideas, and works that have profoundly influenced by thinking across a wide range of topics.

Currently under construction.

- “Don’t walk behind me, I may not lead. Don’t walk infront of me, I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend." -- (supposedly but probably not) Albert Camus.
- “Do not ask who I am and do not ask me to remain the same: leave it to our bureaucrats and our police to see that our papers are in order.” -- Michel Foucault

*Looking at collective systems of meaning as revealing important structural and geneological features of the (social) world.*
- "For language is the armory of the human mind; and at once contains the trophies of its past, and the weapons of its future conquests." -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
- "We are accustomed to call concepts metaphysical if we have forgotten how we reached them. One can never lose one’s footing, or come into collision with facts, if one always keeps in view the path by which one has come." -- Ernst Mach.

*The necessity of existential phenomenology in making sense of our experience and ethical life.*
- Forthcoming.
- Sartre

*Skepticism of Platonist formulations of "evil", "suffering", and "identity" in ethics and politics.*
- Banality of evil

*Philosophy is always reactive towards real problems, and works towards them by creating new concepts. But it should not fall into Plato's cavernous trap and delude itself of its isolated importance.*
- "The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk." -- Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.
- Wimsatt
- Feminist philosophers of science (Haraway)
- Deleuze
