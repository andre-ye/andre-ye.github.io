I've officially [graduated](https://www.instagram.com/p/DK6Mzcuuy0X/){:target="_blank"} from the University of Washington with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Philosophy (Honors).
I [served as the gonfalnier](https://www.instagram.com/p/DK6JxAAOQ-6/){:target="_blank"} (banner carrier) for the College of Arts and Sciences at UW's 150th Commencement!
I also received the CSE Outstanding Graduating Senior award at the Allen School Graduation.
I'm very excited to start my next chapter this fall at MIT!
