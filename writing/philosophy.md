["Wor(k/d)play."](files/workdplay.pdf){:target="_blank"} *Garden of Ideas*, Vol. 2, 2023 - Issue 1. Not released yet.

> <small>**Abstract.** In this essay, we challenge the notion that wordplay lacks depth and meaning. Drawing from philosophers like Plato, Derrida, Wittgenstein, and Saussure, we explore wordplay as a playful engagement with signifiers and their relationships. By embracing irony and comedic play, we uncover new perspectives on language and its limitations. We argue that wordplay offers a valuable tool for critical writers to expand meaning and open doors to alternative modes of understanding. This essay encourages the embrace of wordplay as a meaningful means of inquiry and expression. *Disclosure: LLM-generated abstract.*</small>

["Economy of the Dataset: Marx and Large Language Models."](files/economy-of-the-dataset.pdf){:target="_blank"} Written for Reboot Fellowship, 2023 cohort. March 2023.

> <small>**Abstract.** I argue that the massive datasets utilized by large language models introduce metaphysical and theological complexities, which can be better understood through an examination of Marx's analysis of commodities and capital. I contend that the focus shifts from the content to the form of data in the creation of general-purpose language models, resulting in a fetishization of the Dataset itself. By exploring the parallels between form as money and the concealment of labor, I shed light on the philosophical implications of dataset creation and its impact on our understanding of new technologies. This analysis aims to offer computer scientists, laypersons, and philosophers a nuanced perspective on the economy of the Dataset and how language models interact with and manipulate information. *Disclosure: LLM-generated abstract.*</small>

["The Wartime State and the Cigarette: Darkness and Temporality in *Pale Horse, Pale Rider*."](files/00144940.2022.pdf){:target="_blank"} *The Explicator*, Volume 80, 2022 - Issue 1-2, pages 30-33. https://doi.org/10.1080/00144940.2022.2063706.

> <small>**Abstract.** Although often overlooked due to its sparse occurrence, the symbol of the cigarette offers a new model to understand key themes of darkness and temporality in Katherine Anne Porter’s *Pale Horse, Pale Rider*. Adam is Miranda’s metaphorical cigarette, a device of light and relief from a society pervaded by the darkness of war and sickness. Despite Miranda’s pleas, Adam is committed to his guaranteed extinguishment serving in the war. The driving motion throughout the novella is that of an unspoken but relentless temporality - the metaphorical cigarette flame ceases into darkness as Adam’s departure nears. This temporality can be understood as a creation of the wartime state, whose systematic movement and organization of human life dominate Adam’s being and hence controls Miranda’s psychological being and self-relation to her world. Porter’s work illustrates the devastating power of the wartime state to impose the metaphysics of inevitable darkness upon its citizens.</small>
