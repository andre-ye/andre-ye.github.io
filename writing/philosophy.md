    <small><bold>Abstract.</bold> In this essay, we challenge the notion that wordplay lacks depth and meaning. Drawing from philosophers like Plato, Derrida, Wittgenstein, and Saussure, we explore wordplay as a playful engagement with signifiers and their relationships. By embracing irony and comedic play, we uncover new perspectives on language and its limitations. We argue that wordplay offers a valuable tool for critical writers to expand meaning and open doors to alternative modes of understanding. This essay encourages the embrace of wordplay as a meaningful means of inquiry and expression. <em>Disclosure: LLM-generated abstract.</em></small>

    <span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <small><bold>Abstract.</bold> I argue that the massive datasets utilized by large language models introduce metaphysical and theological complexities, which can be better understood through an examination of Marx's analysis of commodities and capital. I contend that the focus shifts from the content to the form of data in the creation of general-purpose language models, resulting in a fetishization of the Dataset itself. By exploring the parallels between form as money and the concealment of labor, I shed light on the philosophical implications of dataset creation and its impact on our understanding of new technologies. This analysis aims to offer computer scientists, laypersons, and philosophers a nuanced perspective on the economy of the Dataset and how language models interact with and manipulate information. <em>Disclosure: LLM-generated abstract.</em></small>

    <small><bold>Abstract.</bold> Although often overlooked due to its sparse occurrence, the symbol of the cigarette offers a new model to understand key themes of darkness and temporality in Katherine Anne Porterâ€™s *Pale Horse, Pale Rider*. Adam is Mirandaâ€™s metaphorical cigarette, a device of light and relief from a society pervaded by the darkness of war and sickness. Despite Mirandaâ€™s pleas, Adam is committed to his guaranteed extinguishment serving in the war. The driving motion throughout the novella is that of an unspoken but relentless temporality - the metaphorical cigarette flame ceases into darkness as Adamâ€™s departure nears. This temporality can be understood as a creation of the wartime state, whose systematic movement and organization of human life dominate Adamâ€™s being and hence controls Mirandaâ€™s psychological being and self-relation to her world. Porterâ€™s work illustrates the devastating power of the wartime state to impose the metaphysics of inevitable darkness upon its citizens.</small>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <small><bold>Abstract.</bold> Drawing upon the computational paradigm of the Generative Adversarial Network, used in the field of Artificial Intelligence to produce DeepFakes and other literal digital simulacrum, we formulate a computational-adversarial framework to understand the evolution of simulacrum-producing machines into maturity. Such a framework provides a strongly materialist mode of cultural and social analysis. Across its demonstrated application across four contexts â€“ the designation of intelligent beings, the tangibility and deterrent power of nuclear weapons, the simulacra of gender, and the contradictions of colonialism â€“ it proves to be a useful intellectual scaffold both to understand and reinterpret simulacrum and simulations. Crucially, it allows us to discover and understand â€“ in very present, palpable, materialist terms â€“ internally antagonistic wholes that generate unity out of difference and uncover difference in unity, systems for which self-reflection is simultaneously self-refraction.
