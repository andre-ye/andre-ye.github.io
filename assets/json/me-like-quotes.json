The first positive ethical task would be to analyze the processes of subjectivation (passive syntheses) by which modes of existence are determined.

For Deleuze, this is the point of convergence that unites Nietzsche and Spinoza. It is never a matter of judging degrees of power quantitatively; the smallest degree of power is equivalent to the largest degree once it is not separated from what it can do. It is rather a question of knowing whether a mode of existence, however small or great, can deploy its power, increasing its power of acting to the point where it goes to the limit of what it \"can do\". Modes are no longer \"judged\" in terms of their degree of proximity to or distance from an external principle, but are \"evaluated\" in terms of the manner by which they \"occupy\" their existence: the intensity of their power, their \"tenor\" of life. What an ethics of immanence will criticize, then, is not simply modes of thought derived from base modes of existence, but anything that separates a mode of existence from its power of acting.",

History, in this sense of the term, is what separates us from ourselves, and what we have to traverse in order to think ourselves, whereas the actual is the formation of the new, the emergence of what Foucault called our \"actuality.\" To diagnose the becomings in each present that passes is the task that Nietzsche assigned to the philosopher as a physician, \"the physician of civilization,\" or the inventor of new immanent modes of existence. To act against the past, and therefore on the present, in favor (one hopes) of a time to come: such, for Deleuze, is the task of the philosopher. This time to come is not the future of history, but the Now that is distinguished from every present; it is not an instant but a becoming, the \"actual\" or the \"untimely,\" the conditions for the production of the new.",

Both these endeavors, however, had their genesis in the imposition of the notion of infinitesimals as a problematic concept, which in turn gave rise to differing but related axiomatizations.

Radio and television have spread this spirit everywhere, and we're riddled with pointless talk, insane quantities of words and images. Stupidity's never blind or mute. So it's not a problem of getting people to express themselves but of providing little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find something to say. Repressive forces don't stop people expressing themselves but rather force them to express themselves; What a relief to have nothing to say, the right to say nothing, because only then is there a chance of framing the rare, and ever rarer, thing that might be worth saying.

You can't just tell someone what they're saying is pointless. So you tell them it's wrong. But what someone says is never wrong, the problem isn't that some things are wrong, but that they're stupid or irrelevant. That they've already been said a thousand times. The notions of relevance, necessity, the point of something, are a thousand times more significant than the notion of truth. Not as substitutes for truth, but as the measure of the truth of what I'm saying. It's the same in mathematics: Poincaré used to say that many mathematical theories are completely irrelevant, pointless; He didn't say they were wrong – that wouldn't have been so bad.",
