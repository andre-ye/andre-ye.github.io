    "quote": "The process of experience is accordingly understood as being both the process of applying determinate conceptually contentful norms in judgment and intentional action and the process of instituting those determinate conceptually contentful norms. Regarded retrospectively, that process of determination is one of discovery. It is the gradual, progressive finding out what the content has been all along: what norm implicitly governed and governs applications of the concept in judgment. Regarded prospectively, that same process of determination is one of invention. It is the gradual, progressive fixing of the content: making a partially indeterminate content ever more determinate by applying the concept in novel circumstances. Because he thinks of determinateness in this way, Hegel rejects the possibility of conveying the content of a concept by defining it. As a matter of deep pragmatist semantic principle, the only way to understand the content of a determinate concept, he thinks, is by rationally reconstructing an expressively progressive history of the process of determining it. Judgments (and endorsements of practical maxims) are still, as the tradition had it, taken to be applications of concepts. But concepts are now understood as 'functions of judgments.' That is, they are understood in terms of their functional role in determining what one makes oneself responsible for or commits oneself to in judging. At the center of what one is responsible for is having reasons for judging or acting as one does. Concepts are rules that determine what counts as a reason for (or against) applying them, and what applying them counts as a reason for (or against). In Kant's usage, 'discursive' means 'of or pertaining to the use of concepts.' Discursive beings live and move and have their being in a normative space of reasons. Discursive activity is the application of concepts, which is undertaking doxastic and practical responsibilities or commitments by binding oneself by rules in the form of concepts.",

So much of what we do is not a question of can it be done as it is a question of finding a practical way. It is not usually a question of can there exist a monitor system, algorithm, scheduler, or compiler, rather it is a question of finding a practical working one with a reasonable expenditure of time and effort.
